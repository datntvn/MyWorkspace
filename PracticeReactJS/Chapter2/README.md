# # Practice React JS - Chapter!

# This is my quick verify the correctness (i.e runnable) by copy & paste the source code from the book, I also combine with some source from github repo of this book.  
  
# Actually, I have to say that this book is organized in a way that is not easy to understand the concept. It could be used as an explanation for the source code it provided via gitrepo. Other than that, the content within the book is clumsy, messup, not-well-organized.
  
# There should have been more granular in the way that idea should have been developed for the sample project. The author had jumped over too many stories/requirements, added bunch & bunch of code that make it very hard for the reader to find out the main point of each chapter.  
  
# In my opinion, the content could have been made with smaller increment, e.g:  

```Making a page to display products.json sparately with other things```  
  
Only by making this, focusing on list of products, it could explain more detail on many aspect rather than jumping through too many mixed up between JSX template's code, CSS code from bootstrap component, Flux concept is mixed up with ReFlux implementation. Other than that, there are many errata even in the source code, error of typo, misunderstand the concept of Flux also (about misunderstanding Flux, please refer to my note, i.e File excel, you can see the comparison between Flux and Redux, within that, I point out the incorrect content)
