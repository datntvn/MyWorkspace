# ReactJS Basics

This is a second exercise that I made for myself. This one use SAGA to request to an API and then dispatch the result to ReactComponent.

Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aH2qQGgugG0

# Usage
Run npm install, and then , npm run build

Open chrome, F12 to view console, then from within console enter this command:

dispatcher.fetchUsers() 

Then you'll see the logger's content of 2 action dispatched.
