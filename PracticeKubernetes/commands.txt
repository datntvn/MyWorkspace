------------------Session 1: Some useful commands------------------
docker build -t projectFolder/lobsters:2.1.0 lobsters
docker images
kubectl create -f deployments/lobsters.yaml

kubectl get secrets
  kubectl describe secrets/<name of any secret from above command>

------------------Session 2: Deploy a demo-------------------------
(1) get the application to deploy
- make sure nothing running:
  $ kubectl get pods
- we need mysql, so we need a deployment to deploy mysql

(2) run this command to create the deployment for the above mysql
- $ kubectl create -f deployment/mysql.yaml
- we check the result by below command
  $ kubectl get pods
- at this time, "mysql" container is being created

(3) we have to create a service for this, so that other application can find it
- $ kubectl create -f service/mysql.yaml
- we can check by :
  $ kubectl get svc

(4) The next thing we need is our web app
- Let's deploy the application
- $ kubectl create -f deployment/lobsters.yaml
- Check again by: $ kubectl get pods
- We will get an IP address, check by: $ kubectl get svc

(5) create the database migration
- we need to run a job one time 
- we need to follow the same flow, no need to go to server, no jumb box
- we give a workflow to the scheduler: run one rake task, once, until it's successful, then kill it
  + similar to a web-app but we just run 1 command, then exit
- $ kubectl create -f jobs/lobsters-db-schema-load.yaml
- we can review by: $ watch kubectl get jobs
