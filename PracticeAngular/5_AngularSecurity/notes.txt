  Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50320193/ajv-keywords3-2-0-requires-a-peer-of-ajv6-0-0
  Tried:
    - npm i ajv
    - npm install ajv-keywords@3.4.0

Another problem:
  > node-gyp rebuild

  xcode-select: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode, but active developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools instance

npm WARN codelyzer@4.2.1 requires a peer of @angular/common@>=2.3.1 <7.0.0 || >6.0.0-beta <7.0.0 but none was installed.
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
npm ERR! errno 1
npm ERR! argon2@0.16.2 install: `node-gyp rebuild`


My NOTE: ---> does not have time for now to solve all problem with "npm install" , so skip this for now,
