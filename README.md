Within it I have **StandardMicroService**. If you want to have a standard structure of spring-boot microservices project, with Mybatis integration, and log4j ready, then you can clone this project and make some modification as per your requirement.

Project **MicroSrvAdapter** is a template for implementing an Adapter for Microservices. It is implemented with Log4j, properties files separated to different environments, dev, test, staging, production. It has JUnit within it to be ready for TDD. Endpoints for external API are stored within another property file to centralize a single source for all URLs. Messages is stored within another property file to centralize messages used for this project.
